<h3>What is ContentLook?</h3>

ContentLook helps you take a look at your whole Content Marketing strategy, including your 6 main areas: <strong>Blogging</strong>, <strong>Traffic</strong>, <strong>Social Media</strong>, <strong>SEO</strong>, <strong>Links</strong> and <strong>Authority</strong>.

With a simple look, you can see which areas need your immediate attention and you can start fixing them. If you want, you can send the report to one of your team mates and get him to fix that issue. You can even send them to your team, by departments (the content writers, developers, seo people, marketers, managers, etc.).

You’ll get Actionable steps to solve each issue, and also some PRO Tips to help you out.

If your developers need “solid” documentation about some of the issues, you’ll have that for them as well with ContentLook. You can always get easy tips and easy to follow instructions, but you can also get some pretty heavy details, if your team requires this from you.

<h3>What Will You Get?</h3>

* an Audit Score for your Content Strategy and it’s Execution
* insights about the 6 main areas of your content strategy (Blogging, Traffic, SEO, Social Media, Links and Authority)

* insights on How To Fix every issue that appears over time
* weekly Audit by email
* send to team members (directly from the report), by email
* download as PDF, to help keep track of weekly score improvements
* easy to follow guidelines and explanations, but also heavy documentation for those who require it
